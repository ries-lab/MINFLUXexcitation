# MINFLUXexcitation
Fast and robust 3D MINFLUX excitation with a variable phase plate

Takahiro Deguchi and Jonas Ries

Software to calculate MINFLUX PSFs and CRB. Use the script [PSF_Simulation_main.m](/PSF_simulation) to calculate PSFs. Alternatively, you can download them [here](https://ucloud.univie.ac.at/index.php/s/ZyedA9whJOqdKbg).

To calculate CRBs, please first install SMAP from [here](https://github.com/jries/SMAP). Then use  the script [plotCRBMinflux_simulPSF.m](/CRBcalculations) to calculate and plot CRBs. 

[variable_phase_plate.nb](variable_phase_plate.nb) is a Mathematica notebook to calculate polarization states using Jones matrices.
